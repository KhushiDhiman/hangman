This project implements a classic game of Hangman in Python.

Features:

Guess a random word letter by letter.
Incorrect guesses result in a loss of lives.
Visually track progress with a hangman display.

Requirements:

Python 3 (tested with version 3.x)
Running the Script:

Save the Python script (e.g., hangman.py) in a directory.

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory.

Run the script using the python command:

python hangman.py
Use code with caution.
How to Play
The game will randomly select a word. You will see underscores representing the unknown letters. Guess letters by entering them at the prompt.

Correct guesses will reveal the letter's positions in the word.
Incorrect guesses will deduct a life and update the hangman display.
The game continues until you guess the word correctly or run out of lives.

Customization
This is a basic Hangman implementation. You can extend it further by:

Adding difficulty levels with varying word lengths or lives.
Including a word bank to choose from instead of random selection.
Keeping track of wins and losses.
